                  <p>  I  am an experimental physicsit, eager to find out about the complex systems at small scale (i.e. micro-nano scale). I love spending a great deal of my time
            in the lab to run experiments, design experimental methods and develop tiny elements and objects. I know myself as a lab rat. Nothing makes me happier than
            accomplishing a succsessful test with useful results :) </p>
        
                    </h4>
                    
                    <h4>
                     <p>I was born in Iran, and have since lived, studied and worked in Tehran, Melbourne,
                    Cairns, Coral sea (yes you assumed right :), in the middle of the ocean on a sailing boat), Siegen, GÃ¶ttingen, Copenhagen, and now Oslo.
                    I have since been priviledged to explore different cultures, traditions and languages by living in different cities around the globe.
                    I have learnt different ways of engaging with nature through different physical activities that have improved the quality of my life tremendousely.
                    That includes sailing, diving, snorkling, swimming in the open ocean, cross country skying and my very favorite one running. Loving the nature is the main reason that
                    I've been actively trying to fight the climate change, by living a conscious and sustainable life.
                    You will read more about it here on my webpage. </p>
                    </h4>
                    
                    <h4>
                    <p>  My passion for mathematics and mostly physics was shaped in my childhood when my father tirelessly answered all my questions and made me analyze
                        every single question and problem I have been encountered. My mother, on the other hand, dreamed of me become a medicine doctor. She was so keen to teach me about
                        human body and anatomy, as such I was already a surgeon :) I did like the medical science too, in fact I loved it but my love towards physics was stronger than anything else. It looks like that the fate led me to become a physicist. Where I am today brings more joy to me than regrets :)
                    </p></h4>
                    
                    <h4> <p> As for my scientific interests, they are mostly based on labarotory-base research combined with theory
        to explain the interactions between two neighbouring surfaces in fluids that can define whether those surfaces stick together
        or fall apart. That might explain many natural phenomena such as earthquakes, rock-fracturing, landslides and avalanches, and sinking cities like Venice in Italy
        (that is sinking into its surrounding lagoon <a target="blank" style="color:#FF0000;" href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/183/4127/849"> over the centuries </a>). Studying the interfacial forces can also help the pharmaceutical industry to
        understand the interaction between drug paricles and human cells. Biologists and medical scientists understand interaction between human body cells and harmful chemical or/and biological agents such as viruses or parasites. In the paint industry the interaction between particles of the
        coloidal dispersion (paint) and the wall decides whether the paint adhere to the wall or comes off.
        To summarize, the interaction forces exist between all elements around us and become effective depending on the distance between the interacting elements.
        In other words, <a target="_blank" style="color:#FF0000;" href="https://www.amazon.com/Intermolecular-Surface-Forces-Jacob-Israelachvili/dp/0123919274"> "these forces govern the behaviour of everyday things." </a>
