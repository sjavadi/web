		<p> I am an experimental physicsit, eager to find out about the complex systems at small scale (i.e. micro-nano scale). I love spending hours and hours of my time 
			in the lab to run experiments, design experimental methods and develop tiny elements and objects for my experiments. I know myself as a lab rat. Nothing makes me happier than 
			accomplishing a succsessful test with useful results :) </p>
			
		<p>	I was born in Iran, and have since lived, studied and worked in Tehran, Melbourne, 
			Cairns, Coral sea (yes you assumed right :), in the middle of the ocean on a sailing boat), Siegen, Göttingen, Copenhagen, and now Oslo. 
			I have since been priviledged to explore different cultures, traditions and languages by living in different cities around the globe. 
			I have learnt different ways of engaging with nature through different physical activities that have improved the quality of my life tremendousely. 
			That includes sailing, diving, snorkling, swimming in the open ocean, cross country skying and my very favorite one running. As we all have experienced, life is a very bumpy road where every individual
			needs to find a way to cure their wounds and restart after a failure. My way of doing so is doing any of the above activities in the nature. Because of that I am actively trying to fight the climate change, by living a conscious and sustainable life.
			You will read more about that matter here on my webpage. </p>
			
		<p>	My passion for mathematics and mostly physics was shaped in my childhood when my father tirelessly answered all my questions and taught me to think and analyze 
			every single question and problem in the math lessons. My mother, on the other hand, dreamed of me become a medicine doctor. She was so keen to teach me about 
			human body and anatomy. I did like the medical science too, in fact I loved it but my love towards physics was stronger than anything else. It was my fate to be a physicist. Where I am today brings more joy to me than regrets :) 
		</p>
			
			
        <p> To cut the story short, I must say that I strongly believe that this universe works amazingly. From the tiniest particle on this planet, Quark, to the biggest mass all have various properties among which, each would be enough for one scientist’s life time to discover.  
		Hope I can discover something before I kick the bucket. </p>
